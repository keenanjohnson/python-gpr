# CMake Build System Implementation

This document describes the CMake build system implementation for python-gpr with scikit-build-core integration.

## Overview

The project now uses a modern build system combining:
- **CMake** for C++ compilation and dependency management
- **scikit-build-core** as the Python build backend
- **pybind11** for creating Python bindings
- **GPR library** integration via git submodule

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `CMakeLists.txt` (Root)
- Sets up the main build configuration
- Integrates with the GPR library build system
- Configures pybind11 for Python bindings
- Includes cross-platform compatibility settings
- Links all necessary GPR libraries

### 2. `pyproject.toml` (Updated)
- Changed build backend from setuptools to scikit-build-core
- Added pybind11 and scikit-build-core to build requirements
- Configured scikit-build options for cross-platform builds
- Added platform-specific CMake arguments

### 3. `src/python_gpr/_core.cpp` (New)
- Minimal pybind11 binding implementation
- Demonstrates GPR library integration
- Provides foundation for future GPR functionality

### 4. `src/python_gpr/__init__.py` (Updated)  
- Modified to import the C++ extension module
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Build Process

The build process now works as follows:

1. **scikit-build-core** reads configuration from `pyproject.toml`
2. **CMake** configures the build:
   - Finds pybind11 installation
   - Builds GPR library dependencies
   - Creates Python extension module
3. **pybind11** compiles C++ bindings into a Python module
4. **GPR libraries** are statically linked into the extension

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

The implementation includes platform-specific settings:

### Windows
- Uses static MSVC runtime (`MultiThreaded`)
- Enables exception handling (`/EHsc`)

### macOS  
- Sets minimum deployment target (10.9)
- Uses libc++ standard library

### Linux
- Enables position-independent code (`-fPIC`)
- Standard GCC compilation

## Testing the Build

The CMake build system has been validated to:
- ✅ Configure successfully with CMake
- ✅ Find and integrate GPR library
- ✅ Link pybind11 correctly  
- ✅ Build C++ extension module
- ✅ Import and execute Python bindings
- ✅ Provide foundation for GPR functionality

## Next Steps

With the build system in place, future development can focus on:
1. Implementing actual GPR functionality in `_core.cpp`
2. Adding comprehensive Python API in the core modules
3. Creating tests for GPR conversion functionality
4. Building wheels for distribution

## Known Limitations

- Some optional GPR libraries (vc5_decoder, vc5_encoder, tiny_jpeg) are not built in the current GPR submodule state
- The current bindings are minimal placeholders
- Full pip install may require network access for dependency resolution

The build system infrastructure is complete and ready for feature development.
